# Selenium-Testing

This is a Selenium-Pytest demo. In this project I apply tests in demo sites https://demoqa.com by ToolsQA.com, in pages /automation-practice-form and /login.<br/>
Tests setup is for Chrome, Firefox and IE browsers and the choice is done by terminal. **pytest -v -s  --driverName=chrome**
