# Selenium-Testing

**PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

  * This is a **Selenium-Pytest** demo. In this project I apply tests in demo site https://demoqa.com by **ToolsQA.com**, in pages:
        /automation-practice-form and /login.<br/><br/>
  * Tests setup is for Chrome, Firefox and IE browsers and the choice is done by terminal. **pytest -v -s --driverName=chrome**.<br/><br/>
  * The inputs are static, but are about to be inserted dymamically.
