# Selenium-Testing

**PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

This is a **Selenium-Pytest** demo. In this project I apply tests in demo site https://demoqa.com by **ToolsQA.com**, in pages:
        /automation-practice-form and /login.<br/><br/>
Tests setup is for **Chrome**, **Firefox** and **IE** browsers and the choice is done by terminal. **pytest -v -s --driverName=chrome**.<br/><br/>
The inputs are static, but are about to be inserted dymamically.<br/><br/>
The main taget is:
  * by the **assertion**, to compare the expected with the actual outcomes
  * create a **report** of test enviroment,test cases test pass/fail. Also give an automated screenshot file with the browser test result
  * deliver a **error-warning** level report.
